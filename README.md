Official implementation of our paper on efficient multimodal object detection for remote sensing images using adaptive illumination guidance and transformer-based architecture.

![Method Overview](fig1.png) *(You can add a diagram of your framework here)*

## Key Features
- üöÄ Single backbone network for efficient multimodal (visible + infrared) feature extraction
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Adaptive illumination guidance branch for robust feature learning
- üîç Foreground-aware query refinement module for discriminative object queries
- ‚öñÔ∏è Optimal balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency
- üèÜ State-of-the-art performance on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets

## Datasets
Our method has been evaluated on:
- [DroneVehicle Dataset](https://github.com/VisDrone/DroneVehicle)
- [VEDAI Dataset](https://downloads.greyc.fr/vedai/)

*(Add specific preparation instructions when code is uploaded)*

## Installation
*(Will be updated when code is released)*
```bash
# Coming soon
git clone https://github.com/cq100/EIMDet.git
```

## Usage
*(Will be updated when code is released)*
```python
# Sample usage will appear here
from models import AdaptiveIlluminationDetector

# Initialize model with pretrained weights
detector = AdaptiveIlluminationDetector(backbone='resnet50')


## Coming Soon
üöß **Code Under Preparation** üöß  
We're currently finalizing the codebase and documentation. The complete implementation including:
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Pretrained models
- Detailed configuration files
- Comprehensive documentation

will be released shortly. Please watch this repository or check back later for updates!
